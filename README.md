# Contact Frontend Pairing Exercise

Thanks for taking the time to do a pairing exercise with us! We're really looking forward to it.

This is the codebase we'll be working on together – we'll fix some failing tests, and then add some additional functionality, but we'll tell you more about that on the call.

This is a fairly standard [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) application, using [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/). It mimicks part of our talent application flow – it's a simple form that collects some information about the user.

## Getting Started

This codebase uses npm, not Yarn, so to get started you'll need to install the dependencies via `npm install`.

There's two standard CRA scripts that are relevant to us:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.
